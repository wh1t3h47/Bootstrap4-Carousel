# Bootstrap4-Carousel
This is an implementation of a multi-item carousel, sliding one image at a time with bootstrap 4 and jquery
## Motivation
I couldn't find a working example of a multi-item carousel that wouldn't slide all itens at once in bootstrap 4, so I made a quick adaption of one that was originally designed to be used with bootstrap 3
## Features
1. Uses documentfragment to keep DOM operations as optimal as possible
# TODO
fix CSS animation
create a working example
